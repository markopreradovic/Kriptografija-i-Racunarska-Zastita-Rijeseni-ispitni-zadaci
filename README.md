This repository contains practical implementations of cryptographic concepts from the Cryptography and Computer Security course. All solutions are implemented in **Bash** using **OpenSSL**, covering fundamental cryptographic operations and protocols.

## Contents

### Core Cryptographic Concepts
- **Symmetric Encryption**: AES, DES implementations
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: RSA key generation and operations
- **Hash Functions**: SHA-256, MD5 with practical applications
- **Digital Certificates**: Full PKI workflow (CSR, X.509, self-signed certs)
- **Message Authentication**: HMAC implementation

### OpenSSL Operations
- Key generation (RSA, EC)
- Certificate signing requests (CSR)
- Encryption/Decryption pipelines
- Digital signature creation/verification
